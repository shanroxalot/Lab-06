## Assignment:

1. Write a program in C to read the *Listings.csv* file.

2. Declare a function, sortByHostName, that should sort the data based on hostname.
 
3. Declare a function, sortByPrice, that should sort the data based on price.

4. After sorting, sortByPrice and sortByHostName should write the sorted array to a file.



**General Approach**

1. Declare a struct called 'Listing' with contains all the attributes found in *'Listings.csv'*.

2. Define a function that will take one line of the CSV file and return a 'Listing' struct with corresponding attribute values.

3. Declare an array of the 'Listing' structs.

4. Open the *'Listings.csv'* file with the *fopen()* function in read-mode.

5. Loop through each line of the *'Listings.csv'* file. Feel free to use either the *fgets()* function or the *getline()* function.

6. For each line, call the function you previously defined.

7. Store the result in array of 'Listing' structs.

8. In sortByHostName and sortByPrice, use the qsort() function to sort the array.

9. Use the *fopen()* to open a file in write mode.

10. Use the *fputs()* function or the *fprintf()* to write the sorted array to a file.
